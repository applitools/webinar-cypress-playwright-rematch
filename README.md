# Cypress vs. Playwright: The Rematch

This repository holds the code for the Applitools webinar,
[Cypress vs. Playwright: The Rematch](https://applitools.com/cypress-vs-playwright-rematch-webinar/)!


## The battle

DING DING DING! It’s time for a colossal rematch between two of the hottest testing frameworks of 2022!
[Back in May](https://applitools.com/event/cypress-versus-playwright-let-the-code-speak/),
Cypress and Playwright squared off in an epic 10-round code battle where the audience judged the winner.
Playwright arose victorious, winning seven of the rounds – but with some very slim margins.

Now, it’s time to jump back into the ring!
[Filip Hric](https://twitter.com/filip_hric) will once again represent Cypress,
and [Andy Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda) will return to defend Playwright’s champion title.
In this rematch, Filip and Andy will go deeper than small coding snippets:
they will go head-to-head with full test automation projects covering a live web app,
competing for your votes judging which does it better.
And the faceoff will be moderated by none other than [Beth Marshall](https://twitter.com/Beth_AskHer),
the impartial but oh-so-inquisitive quality champion.

Will new features in Cypress 10 steal the thunder?
Will Playwright’s test generation and tracing abilities send a final KO?
Join us live on September 8 for the showdown of the year!
